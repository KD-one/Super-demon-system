After dealing with Liu Jian, Lin Yi glanced coldly at the two lackeys, who instinctively lowered their heads, avoiding eye contact with him.

Then, Lin Yi turned his gaze towards Wang Xinyi. The coldness in his eyes made her take a step back, but she quickly regained her composure and looked at Lin Yi with determination, refusing to show any weakness.

After all, she had her own reliance.

However, Lin Yi smirked and said, "Don't worry, I won't lay a hand on a woman. But I advise you not to pretend to be a goddess just because you think you're attractive. It's meaningless."

Upon hearing Lin Yi's words, Wang Xinyi's face turned red with anger. She was about to retort, "You're the one pretending to be a goddes..."

But before she could speak, she felt something hit her chest.

At that moment, Lin Yi coldly chuckled and said, "Consider this money as their medical expenses."

Indeed, it was a stack of thick bills!

Wang Xinyi stared blankly at the money that had hit her chest and fallen to the ground. It took her a while to react, and just as she was about to curse, she realized that Lin Yi had already disappeared!

Furious, she turned to Liu Jian and his lackeys and shouted, "You bunch of useless idiots! It's just one person, and yet you three can't even fight back! Useless!"

Liu Jian and his lackeys lowered their heads in shame, but their eyes were filled with intense resentment.

Interrupted by this commotion, Lin Yi had no intention of lingering around. Coincidentally, the school bell rang, signaling the end of classes. Lin Yi headed towards his own classroom.

Lin Yi's class was not an elite class, just an ordinary one. At this moment, it was in a state of chaos, filled with chasing, playing, and various conversations.

However, the entire class was discussing one topic - Lin Yi's act of throwing money!

Lin Yi was a student in his own class, and this sensational event had caused a stir in his class. Previously, Lin Yi had always sat at the back, keeping a low profile and rarely interacting with others, so his presence was hardly noticed.

But ever since news of him throwing money spread, Lin Yi instantly became the center of attention in the entire school. Of course, most people had only heard about the incident but didn't know who Lin Yi was or what he looked like.

However, the students in Lin Yi's class knew him well. They were the most shocked by the incident, and now they were discussing how Lin Yi had thrown away one million yuan.

Some of them had even witnessed the scene firsthand and were excitedly boasting to others, "Hey, you guys didn't see it! The way Lin Yi threw the money was so cool and stylish! Do you know what he said at that time?"

"What did he say?" the people around eagerly asked.

The student grinned and said, "Lin Yi said, 'Give me two minutes, let me go to the bank and get some money. Sometimes I want to show off my wealth.'"

"Wow! Showing off wealth!"

"Yeah, it was really showing off. He just threw away one million yuan! How rich must he be!"

The people around kept agreeing, their faces filled with envy and jealousy. 
Some of the materialistic girls in the class even started to have thoughts, especially since Lin Yi had recently broken up with his girlfriend. They saw an opportunity for themselves.

As the discussion grew more intense, suddenly, everyone seemed to receive a signal. The once lively classroom fell silent in an instant. It was so quiet that you could hear a pin drop.

All eyes turned to the person standing at the classroom door - Lin Yi!

Everyone stared at the person at the center of the news, not understanding why the atmosphere had become so strangely quiet. It felt as if the principal had entered the classroom, and the whole class naturally became exceptionally quiet.

Lin Yi had achieved that effect now.

As Lin Yi walked into the classroom, he didn't say anything. With a calm expression, he walked straight to his seat at the back. As he made his way through the crowded aisle, everyone voluntarily made way for him.

Lin Yi smiled inwardly, thinking to himself, "This is the charm of money. Money is a man's most magnificent attire!"

It wasn't until Lin Yi sat down at his seat that the whispers and murmurs gradually filled the classroom again.

The silence in the classroom was finally broken.

Some girls whispered, "Wow, Lin Yi is so handsome. How did I not notice before? And his physique is so good."

Another girl scoffed, "Oh please, I bet you're only interested in his money."

"No, I mean it. Lin Yi is really handsome, and he has a great body. I just didn't notice it before. If I had, I would have pursued him regardless of his wealth."

"Yeah, now that you mention it, I didn't realize Lin Yi was so good-looking."

Meanwhile, the boys were also whispering among themselves, "Wow, the rich kid is back in class. How rare."

"Yeah, if I had that much money, I wouldn't bother coming to school. It's so tiring!"

"Pfft! You have no idea. Going to school is nothing for him. It's like playing a game for him."

"Yeah, yeah! You're right. Lin Yi's so rich, why is he still wearing the school uniform? And it's not just any uniform, it's Nike!"

"Come on, you don't understand! Do you think he's really wearing a regular school uniform? With his wealth, it's probably a custom-made outfit using the world's most advanced nanomaterials. 
It's designed to keep him cool in summer and warm in winter, but it looks like a regular uniform to keep a low profile. And those Nike shoes? They're probably custom-made, handcrafted shoes designed based on biomechanics!"

Due to the enhancement of his senses from the strength-enhancing potion, Lin Yi naturally had enhanced hearing as well. Unfortunately, he overheard these conversations and almost burst out laughing!

He looked down at his worn-out school uniform and the Nike shoes that were already a size too small. He thought to himself, "Who would have thought that by throwing money, the value of my clothes would increase?"

Lin Yi couldn't help but find it amusing. He had unintentionally become the center of attention, and his classmates were now seeing him in a different light. It was an interesting turn of events.

As the whispers and discussions continued, the classroom gradually returned to its usual lively state. The topic of conversation had shifted, but Lin Yi's presence still lingered in the air.

He sat calmly at his seat, unaffected by the newfound attention. After all, he had already experienced much more in his thirty years of life than a few dozen pairs of curious eyes could ever make him feel.

With a slight smile on his face, Lin Yi focused his attention on the upcoming lessons, ready to continue his journey through the school day.
