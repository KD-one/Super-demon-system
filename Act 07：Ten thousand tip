After leaving the stock exchange, Lin Yi thought for a moment and decided not to go back to school for now. After all, he had just caused such a big commotion. 
It wouldn't be appropriate to go to school now. Besides, Lin Yi now had a hundred demon coins and he really wanted to buy something to try its effect.

So Lin Yi decided to stay at a hotel instead.

Just as he was about to set off, the voice of the demon suddenly sounded again, still with that signature laughter: "Hehehe... I didn't expect it, it seems that you, humans, are not people who are easily controlled. 
It turns out that you exchanged two billion for twenty years with a purpose, rather than being reckless for money."

Accustomed to the unpredictable nature of the demon, Lin Yi continued walking without any abnormality and replied, "Thank you for the compliment, but I really am reckless for money.
However, a mere two billion is not worth exchanging for twenty years. What I have my eyes on is those hundreds of billions, the position of the richest person in China!"

As Lin Yi spoke, he raised his hand on the street and called for a taxi.

Swish, a taxi stopped in front of Lin Yi. Lin Yi ignored the words of the demon, and the demon also disappeared wisely. After getting in the car, the driver asked, "Where are you going, young man?"

"To the Emperor Hotel," Lin Yi replied calmly.

As soon as these four words were spoken, the taxi driver couldn't help but look at Lin Yi a few more times. The Emperor Hotel was the best hotel in Jianghai City, with extremely high consumption. Even a regular room would cost thousands.

The driver couldn't help but think that Lin Yi looked like a poor student, but he didn't expect him to be a hidden rich second-generation.

After a pause, the driver politely said, "Alright, please sit tight."

Then the car started.

Lin Yi could sense the difference in the driver's tone and sighed slightly, shaking his head. People nowadays are truly practical. 
Money makes you a master wherever you go. When he first got in the car, he felt like a poor student and was addressed as "you". 
But as soon as he mentioned going to the Emperor Hotel, a place with high consumption, the attitude immediately became much more polite, addressing him as "sir".

However, Lin Yi still enjoyed the feeling of being respected. Who wouldn't want to be respected wherever they go?

"Be respected wherever they go?" This is especially true for someone like Lin Yi, who was once a poor student and faced constant disdain and contempt in his previous life.   
But now that he has money, he is greeted with applause and admiration wherever he goes.

Soon, they arrived at the Emperor Hotel.

As Lin Yi got out of the car, he looked at the magnificent building and the golden characters that spelled out "Emperor Hotel" and couldn't help but feel a sense of awe.

The Emperor Hotel was grand and luxuriously decorated, the best hotel in Jianghai City. In his previous life, Lin Yi had never set foot inside, only admiring it from afar. 
He would compare the splendor of the hotel to his own shabby appearance, feeling ashamed and inferior. But now, Lin Yi had the confidence. As the saying goes, money gives a man courage. 
The future richest person in China wouldn't care about a mere four-star hotel, would he?

With this thought in mind, Lin Yi smiled faintly, and all the lingering self-doubt vanished.

With his head held high, Lin Yi walked into the Emperor Hotel.

At the entrance, there were waitresses dressed in cheongsams welcoming guests. They stood in two rows, responsible for opening doors and greeting guests.   
These waitresses had excellent figures and beautiful faces. When a guest entered, all eight of them would sweetly exclaim, "Welcome." In addition to saluting, the feeling that a man's vanity will be greatly satisfied.

Lin Yi also walked in calmly, and the beautiful waiters at the door naturally saw Lin Yi, but they all looked around one by one, apparently ignoring Lin Yi's meaning.

They have been standing here to welcome guests, naturally saw Lin Yi from the taxi down, and wearing the old school uniform,
natural heart disdain, after all, come here are Mercedes-Benz BMW, this poor ghost is estimated to be here to apply for the waiter.

So as soon as Lin Yi walked to the door, these people all pretended not to see it, and did not even open the door!

Lin Yi's eyes narrowed in an instant, a dangerous light flashed out, but the smile on his face became more and more intense, this is Lin Yi's habit, the more angry he will laugh more happy, 
this is he once practiced when he was a gangster, gangster pay attention to bluffing, Yin people when to pretend to be ruthless, when to pretend to be kind, Lin Yi knew all.

When fighting for territory with people, Lin Yi always let the other side scold with a smile, the more the other side scold Lin Yi, the happier he will smile, and then when the other side relaxed its guard, 
smiled and took out the brick behind the opponent, giving the opponent a hard blow, ensuring that the opponent has not reacted to it has fallen.

It was because of this that Lin Yi had earned the nickname "Smiling Tiger Lin Yi" during his time in the underworld.

Just as Lin Yi was smiling and about to open the door himself, a waitress at the end of the line stepped out and hurriedly came to open the door for him, with a face full of apology.

Lin Yi was slightly surprised but allowed her to open the door.

"Welcome," the cheongsam-clad waitress said apologetically.

Lin Yi nodded and carefully looked at her.   Her hair was elegantly styled in a bun, and the red cheongsam accentuated her tall figure. 
She had light makeup on her sweet face, but the only flaw was the small freckles on her face, which was probably why she was placed at the end of the line.

But what did that matter?

Even if she had freckles on her face, what did it matter? Lin Yi believed that even if someone had physical imperfections, as long as they had a kind heart, it was enough. When one door closes, another one opens. 
If someone had flaws in their appearance but had a good heart, it was far better than being superficial and judgmental.

With a slight smile, Lin Yi took out a stack of ten thousand yuan bills from his pocket and handed it to the waitress, saying, "Take it, as a tip for you."

The waitress was stunned, and the other waitresses behind her widened their eyes in disbelief.  What!  Did I see it correctly?  He just gave a ten thousand yuan tip directly!  He's not here for a job interview, is he?

This poor student is so rich!  Why do wealthy people these days like to keep a low profile?  If I had known, I would have applied here!

Instantly, all the other waitresses looked at the waitress who received the tip with envy, jealousy, and resentment.

The waitress, on the other hand, became nervous and stammered, "Sir...  I haven't done anything.  How can I accept your tip?  And...  so much?"

Lin Yi directly placed the money in her hand and calmly said, "Who said you haven't done anything?  You opened the door for me, didn't you?"

"But...  I just opened the door for you.  How can you give me so much money?" the waitress nervously replied.

"That's right, you only opened the door for me, which would normally earn you a one yuan tip.  But the remaining 9,999 yuan is because you are kind-hearted and not superficial like others.  
When I got out of the taxi, others looked down on me because of my appearance, wearing an old school uniform.  But you treated me with respect as a guest.  To me, that is worth this money.  So, please keep it," Lin Yi explained calmly.

As he spoke, Lin Yi glanced at the other waitresses, and their faces turned pale, alternating between green and white.  They quickly lowered their heads, afraid of catching Lin Yi's attention.  After all, his words were quite obvious.

They regretted not being the one to open the door for Lin Yi.  But some of them also cursed Lin Yi inwardly, thinking, "Damn, if you're so rich, why pretend to be low-key?  Are you deliberately coming here to humiliate us?"

However, no matter what they thought, Lin Yi had already let go of it all.  Completely ignoring the complex gazes of the crowd, he walked towards the front desk.
