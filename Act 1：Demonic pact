"What a pathetic life I've lived!"

These were the last words that came to Lin Yi's mind before he jumped off the building.

As he was suspended in mid-air, the feeling of weightlessness made Lin Yi uncomfortable. 
The wind whistled in his ears, cutting through him like a knife. His eyes were tightly shut against the wind.

But even without opening his eyes, he knew that the ground below was crowded with people. 
They had automatically made way for him, and if nothing went wrong, that would be his grave. 
He would fall and be covered in blood, making it to the headlines of the local news, a topic for people to discuss over tea.

"What a pity, only thirty years old and already jumping off a building."

"Exactly, in the prime of his life, what could have made him so desperate?"

These were the words of people who didn't know him. Those who did would probably say, "Dead? If I were him, I would have killed myself long ago! Why wait until now?"

This was Lin Yi's short and miserable life.

He began to reminisce, a quick overview of his life before death.

He remembered his poor parents back in the countryside, who worked hard to support his education. 
But when he moved to the county for high school, he was captivated by the false prosperity of the city, leading him to fall into a life of debauchery. 
He started dating without his family's knowledge, repeatedly asking for money under the guise of attending cram schools.

He even borrowed money from loan sharks to buy expensive gifts for his materialistic girlfriend. When this was discovered, he was expelled from school. 
If his parents hadn't come all the way from the countryside and knelt in front of the principal in front of the entire school, he wouldn't have had a chance to take the college entrance exam!

But he didn't understand his parents' hardships and felt ashamed of them, publicly disowning them and becoming a laughingstock at school.

In the end, he failed the college entrance exam, and his father died from a stroke caused by anger. His mother was left to support the family alone.

But he continued to associate with unsavory characters in society, and this continued until yesterday. His mother took the last of their money to gamble and ended her life in front of him.

Only then did he realize the extent of his mistakes. 
How much of a scoundrel he had become! How pathetic his life had become! Being called a poor loser by his girlfriend in front of the whole school! Being bullied by gangsters, enduring humiliation! 
His parents kneeling in front of the principal, begging for his chance to take the college entrance exam. This series of events led to the tragic deaths of his parents.

These scenes of tragedy replayed in Lin Yi's mind, fueling his anger and regret. His veins bulged, and his face contorted with rage. 
He wanted to rush down, to change everything, and make that despicable woman pay!

But Lin Yi realized that no matter how hard he tried, he couldn't break through an invisible barrier beneath him. 
It was as if there was an impenetrable wall blocking his path, forcing him to helplessly watch as history repeated itself, step by step.

In that moment, a gust of wind suddenly blew, and the demonic voice seemed to fade into the distance, becoming faint.

And in an instant, the scene before Lin Yi's eyes changed dramatically!

The bustling city transformed into a familiar high school campus, and the desolate autumn turned into scorching summer.

Lin Yi remained suspended in mid-air, invisible to everyone below. He stared blankly at the familiar surroundings, the familiar school uniforms, and the faces of his classmates. 
The memories of twelve years ago flooded back, a day he could never forget. Even the date, May 2nd, twelve years ago, remained etched in Lin Yi's mind.

It was the first day of school after the May Day holiday, and the high school students, dressed in short-sleeved summer uniforms, returned. 
However, instead of entering the school gate, they gathered to witness a spectacle unfolding at the entrance.

A male senior student from the third year stood in confrontation with a female classmate. 
He wore the same school uniform and a pair of Nike sneakers. His face, though still youthful, had turned red with embarrassment.

The female classmate, with delicate makeup on her face, displayed a hint of mature charm that seemed out of place for her age. She looked at the male student with disdain and contempt.

The two engaged in a heated argument, and as Lin Yi watched from above, he clenched his fists. Because the boy below, arguing with the girl, was none other than himself twelve years ago!

Yes, it was today, the day when he was still in his senior year. 
It was the day when this girl publicly dumped him in front of the entire school
exposing his parents as mere farmers and himself as a fraud who extorted money from his parents under the pretense of attending cram schools.

Since then, Lin Yi had been unable to hold his head up in front of his classmates, to the point where he couldn't even bear to go to school. 
He was chased by loan sharks, expelled from school, and his parents had traveled a long distance to kneel in front of the principal. 
This series of events led to the tragic deaths of his parents.

These scenes of tragedy replayed in Lin Yi's mind, fueling his anger and regret. His veins bulged, and his face contorted with rage. 
He wanted to rush down, to change everything, and make that despicable woman pay!

But Lin Yi realized that no matter how hard he tried, he couldn't break through an invisible barrier beneath him. 
It was as if there was an impenetrable wall blocking his path, forcing him to helplessly watch as history repeated itself, step by step.
