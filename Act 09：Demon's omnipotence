"Don't doubt it, you have indeed grown taller. The strength potion works on your body, making it more perfect. So, your previous height of just over 1.7 meters has now become 1.8 meters," said the devil.

"Haha, I can't believe that even though I've passed the age of growing taller, I actually got taller. Let me take a look at my muscles!" Lin Yi said as he took off his shirt.

Looking at himself in the mirror, Lin Yi was stunned. This streamlined body, these two chest muscles, eight-pack abs, this physique! It could definitely charm a lot of girls! 
And Lin Yi's muscles were not like those of gorillas, bulging and making him look big. His muscles were well-proportioned and pleasing to the eye.

Which man wouldn't want a muscular body? But having a muscular body is so difficult to achieve, so how could Lin Yi not be ecstatic now?

Men always care about women's figures, but don't women also care about men's figures?

Now, Lin Yi's height has increased, his appearance has become more handsome, and with this muscular body, if he were in his class, he would definitely be the most handsome!

Lin Yi continued to show off his physique in front of the mirror for a while, then finally satisfied, he shifted his gaze to the clock in the room and suddenly froze!

"Three o'clock!?" Lin Yi exclaimed in surprise. "Is the clock broken? I arrived at the hotel at half past three, how is it only three o'clock now?"

"Don't be confused, it's already three o'clock in the afternoon of the next day. Due to the transformation of your body using the strength potion, you have been asleep for twenty-four hours," said the devil.

"What!" Lin Yi exclaimed. "I was planning to go back to the dormitory at night, but now a whole day has passed. I've skipped a night!"

After speaking, Lin Yi quickly put on his clothes and rushed out of the door! He had to hurry back to school. He was a boarding student, but he had skipped a night last night. 
Skipping a night was not a big deal, after all, Lin Yi was not a good student. But once he skipped a night, the teacher would definitely call his parents. 
What if they happened to mention, "Your son spent a million dollars yesterday!" How would Lin Yi explain that?

So, Lin Yi quickly went down the stairs and headed straight for the door!

At the entrance, the eight receptionists saw Lin Yi and immediately rushed to open the door for him. Unfortunately, Lin Yi didn't even glance at them and rushed out without a second thought.

Even after he left, the sweet voices of the receptionists could still be heard from behind, "Take care, sir! Welcome back next time!"

Lin Yi didn't hear any of it because he was extremely nervous. What if his parents found out about the money he had spent? How would he explain it to them?

In desperation, he thought of the devil! The devil had once said that the money he gave him was absolutely clean, so he must have a reasonable explanation!

With that in mind, Lin Yi couldn't help but ask, "Hey, devil! What if someone investigates the two billion you gave me?"

"Don't worry, those two billion came from your lottery winnings. There's no problem with the source, and it would be the same no matter who investigates," the devil replied nonchalantly.

Although he heard the devil's assurance, Lin Yi was still anxious. Damn it! Winning two billion in the lottery, who would believe it? Would it be convincing enough to explain it to his parents?

He didn't want to affect his parents' lives. In his previous life, his parents died because of him. In this life, Lin Yi couldn't let them suffer even a little bit! He couldn't bear the thought of his parents sneezing or coughing!

"Taxi!" Lin Yi raised his hand to stop a taxi.

After getting in the car, Lin Yi said, "Go to Jianghai No.1 Middle School!"

The driver seemed to sense Lin Yi's urgency and immediately started the car as soon as Lin Yi finished speaking.

Inside the car, the devil's voice rang out again, "Humans are really strange. They can sacrifice their lives for a pile of banknotes, but they can still prioritize their parents over that money."

Lin Yi ignored the devil's sigh. He had no mood for conversation now. He just wanted to know if his teacher had called his parents and if he had revealed the incident of him spending money.

But the devil didn't stop there and continued, "Human, let me remind you that you made a contract with a devil. You have the right to seek the devil's help, yet you are now entangled in such a trivial matter as a phone call."

"What are you trying to say?" Lin Yi said coldly.

Before the devil could speak, the driver spoke first, sounding confused, "I didn't say anything, did I?"

"Hehehe, what I mean is, I can delete your parents' phone numbers from your school's records," the devil said.

"Really!" Lin Yi exclaimed in surprise.

He looked at the empty space in front of him with excitement, completely oblivious to the driver's expression of disbelief, as if he were dealing with a crazy person.

"But how do you know if my homeroom teacher has already called my parents?" Lin Yi asked.

"Human, always remember my identity. I am a demon! All-knowing and all-powerful. Your homeroom teacher indeed intends to call your parents, but he is currently searching through the records and hasn't found them yet," the devil explained.

As the devil spoke, a transparent screen suddenly appeared in front of Lin Yi, revealing his homeroom teacher, Wang Rui Xue. He was a short and chubby middle-aged man, sitting in his office, searching through the records for phone numbers.

Lin Yi no longer paid any attention to the driver in the taxi. He urgently said, "Quick! Delete the phone numbers!"

"Hehehe, very well. But remember, demons don't work for free. I'll take your remaining ten demon coins," the devil chuckled.

Immediately, the screen disappeared, and the image of the homeroom teacher vanished. Lin Yi stood there dumbfounded for a moment before asking, "Did you delete them?"

"Yes, please don't question a demon's abilities," the devil replied in a casual tone, with a hint of mockery. Lin Yi paid no attention to it and let out a sigh of relief. He felt a weight lifted off his shoulders.

After a while, Lin Yi said, "Thank you. Although you claim to be a demon, I feel like you're my guardian angel. Thank you."

The devil remained silent, but the driver spoke anxiously, "We've arrived at No.1 Middle School. Please get off the car."

Lin Yi paused for a moment and asked, "How much is the fare?"

"No, no need to pay. Please go quickly," the driver said with a trembling voice, clearly frightened by Lin Yi's behavior of talking to thin air.

Lin Yi understood the driver's thoughts and smiled faintly. Without saying a word, he took out a hundred yuan bill and placed it on the seat, then swiftly got out of the car.

Leaving behind a perplexed driver, Lin Yi thought to himself, "He must think I'm a crazy rich person."
