Suddenly! The demon burst into laughter, filled with excitement. "Hehehe, I knew I didn't misjudge you. You're truly interesting. Go ahead, the money is already in your bank account."

Immediately, Lin Yi felt his vision change, and he saw Zhang Li's malicious face.

Then, Lin Yi lowered his head in disbelief, looking at his young, uncalloused hands and the pair of Nike shoes that were now a size too small. He clenched his fist tightly, determined. 
He raised his head, his eyes shining with a terrifying brilliance!

Eighteen years old! I'm back!

Zhang Li took a step back, startled by Lin Yi's gaze. She felt a sense of panic. How terrifying! Is he going to hit me?

However, it was clear that her worries were unnecessary because Lin Yi calmly said, "Everyone, did he say I have no money? That I always deceive my parents for money? 
I don't want to explain anything. I just wonder if you can give me two minutes to go to the bank and withdraw some money? Sometimes, I want to be willful and show off my wealth."

Lin Yi's indifferent voice caused a commotion among the people present. Willful? Show off wealth? 
Could it be that Zhang Li's words earlier were false? Was this guy actually rich? Everyone couldn't help but feel puzzled.

Soon, someone shouted, "Go ahead!"

"Become Superman in two minutes!"

"..."

Hearing the cheers from the crowd, Lin Yi smiled faintly and turned towards the bank at the school gate.

Zhang Li was uncertain, feeling that Lin Yi had suddenly changed. His indifference made her uneasy, but she couldn't help but mock, 
"Pretending! Just keep pretending! You poor loser! Show off your wealth? If you can take out ten thousand yuan later, I'll apologize to you!"

But Lin Yi completely ignored Zhang Li's taunts and walked away without looking back. This made Zhang Li's face even uglier!

Soon, Lin Yi entered the bank, out of sight of the crowd. His expression instantly turned cold. Wait, Zhang Li, I will make you regret it for the rest of your life!

With a cold face, Lin Yi walked towards the counter. At that moment, there was a middle-aged man conducting business at the counter. 
Without saying a word, Lin Yi pushed the middle-aged man aside, to the astonishment of the counter lady. He took out a bank card from his pocket and said coldly, "Withdraw two million!"

The counter lady was stunned, and the middle-aged man who was about to scold Lin Yi was also taken aback, staring at this unremarkable high school student.

The string of curses that was about to come out was swallowed back. What a joke! A high school student demanding two million! 
How wealthy must his family be? How could they afford to offend him?

The counter lady hesitated for a moment and then said, "Sir, such a large amount requires an appointment in advance."

She didn't dare to ask Lin Yi to go back and wait in line. 
After all, a high school student who dared to withdraw two million, such a person was not someone a small employee like her could afford to offend.

Moreover, this was twelve years ago when prices were not as high. Two million was a significant sum of money!

Upon hearing that an appointment was required, Lin Yi coldly smiled. Having lived for thirty years, he knew these bank employees too well. 
As long as you had money, you were the boss. Appointment?

Lin Yi directly said, "Go and get your manager!"

"Alright, sir, please wait a moment," the counter lady didn't hesitate and immediately left the counter to find the manager.

Soon, the manager arrived. He was a middle-aged man with a big belly and a slightly balding head. 
He was still adjusting his clothes while sweating profusely, indicating that he hadn't been doing anything good in his office.

When he saw Lin Yi, he didn't give him a good face. After all, he was just a high school student, and his good time had been interrupted.

He thought to himself, damn it, it was not easy for me to get close to the new employee. She had finally stopped resisting and was about to give in. But now, this kid had to interrupt!

Taking two million for his parents? He automatically assumed that Lin Yi was doing it for his parents.

As a bank manager, he had seen a lot of money. What was this kid so proud of?

Although he thought this way, the bank manager still put on a fake smile and said, "Young man, our bank has regulations. Taking such a large amount requires an appointment. 
Otherwise, where would the bank get so much cash? I'm sorry, but please make an appointment and come back."

Young man? Hearing this address and the manager's excuse, Lin Yi coldly smiled, "Alright, in that case, transfer the two billion on my card to another bank account. 
I'll go to a different bank to withdraw."

What! Two billion!

As soon as Lin Yi said this, the entire bank erupted in astonishment!

Everyone stared in disbelief at the unremarkable high school student. Who would have thought that he had two billion in his account? What kind of background did this kid have?

In a county-level city like Jianghai, not everyone could casually take out two billion in cash, especially as a high school student!

The bank manager was also sweating profusely and couldn't recover his composure. He had been stunned by Lin Yi's two billion!

The middle-aged man who had been pushed aside by Lin Yi earlier was also relieved. Thank goodness he didn't curse out loud just now. Otherwise, he might have ended up in trouble!

At this moment, Lin Yi impatiently urged, "Hurry up and transfer!"

The bank manager immediately put on a smile and said, "Esteemed customer, I suddenly remembered that although our bank doesn't have that much cash, the ATM should still have some. 
We can gather it for you. How does that sound?"

"Then go quickly!" Lin Yi replied coldly.

"Uh, um..." The bank manager hurriedly agreed and left with the counter lady.

On their way, the counter lady couldn't help but ask, "Manager, isn't this against the rules?"

The bank manager glared at her and said, "To hell with the rules! In this day and age, money is the rule. What do you know? 
It's two billion we're talking about! All the banks in the country are trying to attract funds, to get more people to deposit money in their banks. 
If we push away these two billion today, tomorrow the bank president will kick both of us out!"

Two minutes later, Lin Yi left the bank with a backpack full of cash. He didn't manage to withdraw two million because the bank was busy and didn't have that much cash available. 
The cash transport vehicle hadn't arrived yet. However, he did withdraw over one million.

But even this amount was enough to blind Zhang Li's eyes!
