As the onlookers saw Lin Yi coming out of the bank, they immediately started to make a commotion, saying, "Look! That guy is coming out!"

"How much money did he withdraw? Could it be all in that backpack?"

Upon seeing Lin Yi, the crowd automatically made way for him to pass.

Lin Yi walked up to Zhang Li, who still had a mocking expression on her face, and disdainfully said：
"You poor bastard finally came out! Hurry up and show me your measly possessions. I'm still waiting to..."

Smack!

Before Zhang Li could finish her sentence, Lin Yi directly slapped her face with a stack of money, interrupting her.

Zhang Li was about to get angry, but she realized that Lin Yi had thrown a stack of bright red banknotes at her! She was stunned. 
Wasn't this ten thousand yuan? When did this guy become so rich?

The surrounding crowd was also shocked! Immediately, there was a buzz of discussion!

"Oh my god, am I seeing this right? He just threw ten thousand yuan at someone?"

"Wow! That's impressive! It's a complete reversal!"

"Now, Zhang Li thought he was a poor guy, but turns out he's a low-key rich man!"

"I remember that woman just said she would apologize if he took out ten thousand yuan!"

The atmosphere suddenly became lively with the ten thousand yuan thrown by Lin Yi!

But it didn't end there. Lin Yi unexpectedly took out several more stacks of money from his backpack and threw them at Zhang Li, one after another!

Due to the force used by Lin Yi, the bright red banknotes scattered everywhere, creating a spectacular scene!

But it still wasn't over! Before the crowd could recover from their shock, Lin Yi emptied his backpack, and piles of banknotes fell at Zhang Li's feet like garbage!

At this moment, the previously lively scene froze. Everyone was in a state of shock, staring blankly at Lin Yi's calm face and the pile of banknotes on the ground.

Zhang Li was also shocked beyond words!

How... how is this possible? Wasn't Lin Yi a poor guy? Weren't his parents just ordinary people? How... how could this be...

At this moment, Lin Yi calmly said, "Zhang Li, this is one million yuan. Take a good look. I want you to know what it means to be wealthy. 
And please, in the future, when you're being materialistic, open your eyes wide and don't mistake shit for gold."

Zhang Li didn't dare to retort after being scolded by Lin Yi, because the impact of one million yuan was too great. 
It could be said that among the people present, some had never seen so much money in their entire lives. Zhang Li was naturally one of them.

Now she looked at Lin Yi, who had a calm expression on his face, and felt like crying without tears. She thought to hersel：
"You, you're so rich, why are you playing it low-key? Are you just trying to test if I truly love you? If you had shown me this money earlier, I would have kneeled and licked you long ago. 
Is it necessary to do it like this now?

Ah... now the golden turtle son-in-law is gone, but fortunately, there's still this one million yuan as a parting gift. It's not too bad after all!"

Lin Yi looked at Zhang Li, who had a pale face and a remorseful expression, but her eyes were fixed on the money on the ground. He immediately understood her thoughts.

He sneered, "No need to look, this one million yuan is not your parting gift. I just wanted to show you what it means to be wealthy."

Zhang Li's face changed instantly, and she was about to say something, but Lin Yi interrupted, "Everyone, let me make it clear here. 
This one million yuan is not the breakup fee for this bitch Zhang Li. It's just something I casually threw away. Whoever picks it up can keep it. Please help yourselves."

After saying that, Lin Yi quickly turned and left.

The people who were still petrified suddenly had fiery gazes! They stared at the money with intense desire. 
Zhang Li's expression kept changing, and she hurriedly picked up the money while shouting, "Stay away, this is my breakup fee, it's all mine!"

If Lin Yi hadn't said that whoever picks it up can keep it, perhaps no one would have rushed to grab it. But now? Heh.

Suddenly, someone in the crowd shouted, "Grab it!"

Immediately, countless onlookers swarmed in, rushing towards Zhang Li with red eyes. Zhang Li was shocked and exclaimed, "Get away! This is my...!"

Before she could finish her sentence, she was already drowned out by the crowd.

Meanwhile, Lin Yi, who had already left the school gate, listened to Zhang Li's cries and coldly laughed, "History will change from this moment!"

"You're right. Since the moment you signed the contract with me, history has already changed," the demon suddenly spoke up.

Although Wen Dong already knew that this demon appeared and disappeared mysteriously, he was still startled by the sudden voice of the demon.

"Damn, can't you give me a heads up next time? It's easy to give me a heart attack like this!" Lin Yi, in a good mood, joked with the demon.

"Oh?    A heart attack, you say? That's simple. You can use your remaining 100 demon coins to purchase a powerful heart-strengthening needle. 
Just one injection will solve all your heart problems," the demon said.

Lin Yi was taken aback and blurted out, "What did you say? Demon coins? And you can buy things with them? What's going on?"

"Oh, right, I forgot to tell you. After you sign a contract with me, you will unlock a demon shop, where you can use demon coins to purchase items. 
It has everything you can imagine, and even things you can't. As long as you have demon coins."

"And demon coins are the currency formed by things that demons like, such as life, souls, and various human desires. These are the demons' favorites."

"How did I get a hundred demon coins?" Lin Yi asked in confusion.

"You forgot, just now you threw down one million yuan, which triggered the greed of hundreds of people. As a result, you obtained a hundred demon coins. 
Of course, if you kill a hundred people, you will get even more demon coins," the demon temptingly said.

Lin Yi's heart skipped a beat. He didn't dare to randomly kill people, not in this life or the previous one. Although he was a scoundrel, he couldn't bring himself to commit murder. 
But fortunately, he could acquire demon coins by stimulating human desires.

"Right, let me see the demon shop quickly!"

As soon as Lin Yi finished speaking, a black screen-like object appeared in front of him, filled with various items written densely on it.

Lin Yi focused his gaze and saw the following:

- Strength-enhancing potion, 20 demon coins.
- Appearance-enhancing potion, 20 demon coins.
- sexual capacity-enhancing potion, 20 demon coins.

After reading this section, Lin Yi was stunned. 
He could understand the concept of strength enhancement, but he didn't expect there to be appearance-enhancing and sexual capacity-enhancing potions. 
Curiosity got the better of him, and he couldn't wait to swipe the screen with his hand to see what else was available.

Half an hour later, with a complex expression, Lin Yi closed the demon shop.

Now he was both happy and sad. He was happy because the demon shop really had everything! It was all-encompassing.

For example, in the technology category, there are various types of firearms such as pistols, submachine guns, sniper rifles, and even nuclear bombs.  
And it doesn't stop there, there are also futuristic weapons like laser guns and spaceships.

In the ancient martial arts category, there are techniques like the Longevity Formula, the Immortality Seal Technique, 
the Demon Cultivation Technique, the Nine Yin Scripture, and the Nine Yang Divine Art.

And in the cultivation category, there are techniques like the Nine Heavens Profound Art, the Nine Nether Demon Art, the Supreme Forget-Me-Not Dao, and the Slaughter Immortal Technique.

Unfortunately, these extraordinary items come with a hefty price tag!  With only a hundred demon coins, you can only afford items from the first two categories.
