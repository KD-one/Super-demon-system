At the age of only eighteen, Lin Yi's face turned red as he stubbornly asked, even in front of so many people, "Lili, what did I do wrong? Why do you want to break up with me?"

Upon hearing Lin Yi's childish question, Zhang Li's face was full of disdain. She raised her head high, like an arrogant princess, looking down at Lin Yi.

Thinking about the three months she had been dating Lin Yi, he had only spent a little over two thousand yuan on her. What a loser!

And Zhang Li had recently learned through some gossip that Lin Yi's family was very poor, his parents were farmers from the countryside. 
The thought of his parents being peasants made Zhang Li feel disgusted. She even washed her hands several times after he touched them.

She also heard that the Nike shoes Lin Yi was wearing were bought with money he stole from his family. 
They were from last year and were already a size too small, but he couldn't bear to throw them away!

What a loser!

Fortunately, I didn't sleep with him. Otherwise, how could I face anyone in the future?

Zhang Li was extremely disappointed. She had always thought highly of herself, living in Jianghai City, a county-level city. 
Relying on her looks, she had always wanted to hook up with the son of a wealthy steel mill owner. 
Jianghai City was known for its steel mills, and the most famous ones were the ones that produced steel.

But because of her bad reputation, she couldn't find a suitable match. Then Lin Yi came along, writing love letters to her. 
Zhang Li thought he looked quite handsome and he seemed generous, so she got involved with him.

But she never expected to later find out that he was just a poor guy, which led to today's breakup scene.

"Lin Yi, I told you, we're not compatible!" Zhang Li looked at Lin Yi, sneering.

"Not compatible?! Why aren't we compatible? Didn't you say we were the perfect match?" Lin Yi couldn't believe it.

"How is that possible! I never said that, and I don't have any feelings for you! The most important thing in a relationship is the feeling!" Zhang Li defended herself.

Hearing Zhang Li's harsh words, Lin Yi's heart felt like it was being cut by a knife. But in the next second, his face became fierce. 
"To hell with your feelings! I bet it's because of Zhang Tianhao, right? 
Because he has a father who owns a steel mill and can buy you expensive bags worth thousands of yuan, so you want to dump me?"

As Lin Yi's words trailed off, he almost roaredÔºÅ

With these words, the surrounding students suddenly became excited, as if they had been injected with chicken blood. 
"Here comes the drama! Here comes the drama!" It was a typical love story between a gold digger and a loser.

Hundreds of students took out their phones and started recording, excited as if they were on drugs. Typical onlookers who loved to watch a spectacle!

Upon hearing Lin Yi's words, Zhang Li became furious. "Lin Yi, how dare you spout nonsense? I already told you, I have no feelings for you."

"Heh, who would believe that?" Lin Yi sneered. "The person I despise the most is someone like you, who pretends to be a goddess all the time. You're clearly obsessed with money, but you always talk about love!"

The onlookers heard Lin Yi's words and agreed, looking at Zhang Li with disdainful eyes. Someone even shouted, "Well said!" This made Zhang Li's face turn extremely ugly!

Seeing Lin Yi's reaction, Zhang Li put her hands on her hips and sarcastically pointed at him, "Are you calling me a gold digger? Well, don't you worship money?! 
Lin Yi, I tell you, don't think I don't know that your parents are farmers, yet you always pretend to be rich at school! 
And the reason you can dress like a dog is because you constantly deceive your parents for money by using the excuse of attending cram schools!
You say I'm materialistic? Do you have the qualifications? I'm just pursuing a better life, but what about you? You're just a scumbag who cheats his parents' money!"

The students in the crowd frowned upon hearing Zhang Li's words, looking at Lin Yi with disgust and contempt.

"Exactly, his parents are farmers. It's not easy for them to earn money all year round. 
This guy, on the other hand, cheats his parents' money and enjoys a luxurious life at school. And he even has a girlfriend? 
I never thought I would be in the same school as someone like him!"

Lin Yi's face turned pale. He didn't expect Zhang Li to know all of this. He stuttered and couldn't say a word.

His reaction made the surrounding onlookers even more convinced, and the mocking voices spread further.

Meanwhile, Zhang Li raised her head high, looking at Lin Yi with even more disdainful eyes.

At this moment, Lin Yi's eyes, bloodshot from anger, stared into the empty space His eyes were now bloodshot and filled with anger. 
He roared, "Put me down! I want to change everything! Where are you, demon? You said you could change my life!"

Finally, the voice of the demon appeared, floating in the air. "Hehehe, feel the anger, human. I like your anger."

"Put me down, you motherfcker!" Lin Yi shouted in madness.

The demon's laughter became even more arrogant. "Put you down? What good would it do if I put you down now? What would you do? Punch this woman? That would only make your reputation worse, and nothing would change."

As the demon mocked him, Lin Yi's face turned pale. He lowered his head, tightly clenched his fists, his nails digging deep into his flesh.

Yes, even if he went down now, what would it change? He would still be a loser, unable to change anything.

Damn it! Money! I need money!

Raising his head, Lin Yi looked ahead with bloodshot eyes, his expression fierce. "Money! Demon, I need money! With money, I can change everything!"

"Hehehe, very well. I like your greed. But I won't help you for free," the demon's voice echoed.

"I can give you one billion, a completely clean source of money. But the price is the last ten years of your life. Are you willing?"

It was a difficult choice!

Faced with this question, some people would refuse because they were already wealthy and one billion was nothing to them. 
They might even be willing to spend one billion to extend their lives.

Others would agree, mostly ordinary people who struggled every day with mortgage and car loans. With one billion, their lives would undergo a complete transformation. 
It could also be young people still in school, relying on their parents' allowance. 
They wanted to earn their own money, make big money, surpass their peers, make their classmates envy them, and make the goddess who once looked down on them bow their heads and sing "Conquer" to them.

And all they had to give up were the most useless ten years of their lives, exchanging them for decades of wealth and glory. Worth it!

When Lin Yi heard the demon's offer, he didn't hesitate for a moment. "Fck it, I'll give you twenty years! Give me two billion!"

Lin Yi's response stunned the demon.
