Because the phone problem has been resolved, Lin Yi is no longer in a hurry and there is no need to come to school at all. However, since he's already here, Lin Yi plans to wander around.

Lin Yi walked in the campus of Jianghai No.1 Middle School, feeling a bit nostalgic. Every tree and blade of grass here is just like in his memories, both familiar and strange.

The small forest path in the campus, where he used to skip classes, was a place he often went to. Back then, he was quite mischievous and liked to intentionally scare the affectionate couples hiding here.

After passing through the forest path, Lin Yi arrived at the playground. Although Jianghai is a county-level city, the government pays great attention to education, so the playground of No.1 Middle School is well-built.

Since it's class time in the afternoon, there are still many students on the green field of the playground, taking physical education classes. 
Lin Yi looked at the young figures sweating on the playground, and a smile unconsciously appeared on his face.

Everything seemed comfortable and peaceful. Lin Yi didn't know why he was smiling, but from the perspective of his thirty-year-old self, the mood here from many years ago was unexpectedly joyful and peaceful.

Lin Yi smiled and murmured, "Youth, it's wonderful."

This sentence contains the sentiment of a wanderer who has experienced storms and setbacks, with a tone that seems to be filled with endless sighs. Rebirth is such a desirable word.

In his previous life, Lin Yi wasted his time and barely lived until he was thirty. He hurt countless people's hearts throughout his life. This time, he has the opportunity to start over, and who can understand this feeling?

This time, I can make up for the people who loved me and were hurt by me in the past.

This time, I can make up for the mistakes I made in my youth.

This time, I can live a life that resembles a human being and live the life I want.

Everything makes Lin Yi feel exceptionally beautiful. He looked around the campus, and even the summer sunlight seemed softer, the chirping of cicadas sounded pleasant, and the young figures on the playground became full of vitality. 
Everything was filled with joy and tranquility.

At this moment, there was a sudden sound next to Lin Yi.

Lin Yi turned his head and saw a round football rolling to his feet. Without being interrupted by anger, Lin Yi just smiled faintly and bent down to pick up the ball and return it to his classmates.

However, just as Lin Yi was about to bend down to pick up the ball, a voice with a spoiled tone sounded, "Hey, you, bring the ball over here."

The voice was exceptionally pleasant to the ears, provided the tone of being spoiled and commanding was removed.

Upon hearing the girl's words, Lin Yi frowned. He disliked the feeling of being ordered around in her voice. He couldn't help but stop his action of picking up the ball and turned his head to look at the source of the sound.

It was a girl wearing a white Adidas tracksuit, a white sports crop top revealing her fair arms, wrapped around a slender waist that could be held with just one hand.    
She wore white sports shorts, showcasing her long and straight legs, glistening in the summer sunlight.

Those two slender and beautiful legs were both delicate and straight, no less impressive than the models on TV. They shone brightly in the summer sun.

It can be said with certainty that any man who sees her for the first time would be instinctively attracted by her long and slender legs, forgetting to even look at her face.

But her appearance was equally impressive. She had a pointed oval face, a high nose bridge, a small and thin cherry mouth, and a pair of autumn-like bright eyes. Her black straight hair cascaded like a waterfall.    
Her whole being exuded youth and vitality.

Anyone who saw such a high school girl would exclaim, "What a youthful beauty!"

But when Lin Yi saw this girl, his brows furrowed even deeper.    How could he not recognize such a beautiful girl?

It can even be said that no one in Jianghai No.1 Middle School doesn't know her because she is the school's beauty queen! Wang Xinyi!

But that's not the only reason she's famous. As the beauty queen, her identity is much more significant!

Because her family is involved in the underworld!

In Jianghai City, public security is not that good, and the underworld is quite rampant.

And the most famous figures in the underworld who can make babies stop crying are only four!

Their names are known by almost everyone in Jianghai City: Wang Yi, Li Er, Wu San'er, Zhao Si!

Their real names are rarely known, but their nicknames are widely known. Yi,Er,San,Si, represent their rankings in the underworld. And this Wang Xinyi, with the surname Wang, is naturally the daughter of the underworld boss Wang Yi.

Just based on this identity, Wang Xinyi's name is known by everyone in Jianghai No.1 Middle School! And coupled with her exceptional beauty, she has countless admirers and is the hottest school beauty in Jianghai No.1 Middle School.

Lin Yi recognized her at first glance. The Lin Yi of the past had also seen Wang Xinyi a few times at school. Every time she appeared, she was surrounded by a group of admirers. Wherever she went, she was the most eye-catching presence.    
In his memory, she always held her head high with a swan-like fair neck, proud like a little princess.

The commanding tone of Wang Xinyi's order disgusted Lin Yi. The current Lin Yi didn't care about Wang Yi, Li Er, Wu San'er, Zhao Si! Naturally, there was no need to go against his own principles. 
Therefore, he ignored Wang Xinyi's words, gave her a cold glance, and turned his head to walk away.

Wang Xinyi had intended for the boy in the distance to pick up the ball, but who would have thought that he would just glance at her and walk away!

For Wang Xinyi, who had always been treated like a princess, this was an unprecedented insult. 
In Jianghai No.1 Middle School, and even in the entire city of Jianghai, how many people dared not listen to her? And he even gave her a disdainful look!

Feeling her dignity being challenged, Wang Xinyi couldn't help but shout, "Hey, stop right there! Didn't you hear me asking you to pick up the ball?"

Upon hearing Wang Xinyi's shout, Lin Yi immediately stopped in his tracks.

Wang Xinyi's face was filled with a smug smile, but before her smile could fully form, it froze instantly.

She saw Lin Yi come to a halt, looking at her with a chilling smile. He lightly lifted his right foot and kicked the football on the ground with force.

Being enhanced by strength-enhancing potions, Lin Yi's kick was powerful and heavy. With a loud "peng" sound, the football turned into a shooting star and flew out of the playground, disappearing into the distance.

Wang Xinyi stood there in astonishment, witnessing Lin Yi's ability to kick the ball out of the playground. She couldn't believe it. After all, he was standing outside the field!

In other words, he kicked the ball directly across the entire football field!

At that moment, Lin Yi sneered and said, "Next time, be more polite. Not everyone is your servant. As for the ball..." Lin Yi took out a 100 from his pocket and threw it on the ground.

"This should cover the cost of your football."

With that, Lin Yi turned around and walked away.

On the other hand, Wang Xinyi's face turned pale and green. She was not only angry at what Lin Yi said, but also at his arrogant attitude. He even threw a hundred bill directly!

Since she could remember, no one had dared to be so arrogant in front of her. Everyone was always respectful. This was the first time she had encountered such a person!

Furious, Wang Xinyi shouted, "Stop! Who told you to leave!"
