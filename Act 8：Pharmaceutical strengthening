"Is there a presidential suite?" Lin Yi asked the front desk attendant.

"Yes, sir, there is, but the cost of the presidential suite..." the front desk attendant hesitated, looking at Lin Yi, who was wearing a tattered school uniform.

Lin Yi took out a stack of ten thousand yuan bills from his pocket and placed them on the counter, saying, "Is this enough?"

The attendant was clearly startled by Lin Yi's action. It was quite shocking for a seemingly ordinary poor student to casually take out ten thousand yuan bills. 
She quickly realized that someone who could easily produce such a large sum of money must be someone extraordinary. She hurriedly smiled and said, "That's enough, sir. 
Please show me your ID, and I'll arrange it for you right away."

With the influence of money, the efficiency of the staff at the front desk immediately increased. Soon, Lin Yi was escorted to the presidential suite.

Even though Lin Yi knew that the presidential suite would be luxurious, he was still slightly surprised when he entered. 
The room was beautifully decorated, much larger than a typical apartment. It had a LCD TV, a computer, a large bed, and the floor was adorned with golden patterns. 
There were also beautiful bonsai plants.

What pleased Lin Yi the most was the bathtub that could accommodate two people. He could now enjoy a relaxing bubble bath, just like in the movies.

However, Lin Yi quickly snapped out of his reverie because he knew that his future residence would be even more upscale and definitely not inferior to this place.

He took off his shoes and lay on the bed, then quickly accessed the interface of the Devil Shop. As soon as he opened it, Lin Yi noticed that his Devil Coins had increased by ten!

How did this happen?

After a moment of contemplation, Lin Yi realized that it must be because he absorbed the desires of the middle-aged man when he spent money on stocks, 
as well as the desire for money from the waitress when he gave her a tip, and the envy of others. All of these had turned into his Devil Coins.

Understanding the key points, Lin Yi eagerly started to make purchases. After all, who wouldn't be excited to possess such surreal items?

After some hesitation, Lin Yi decided to buy a bottle of performance-enhancing potion. After all, which man wouldn't want a slightly larger size for their penis? 
With a mindset of giving it a try, Lin Yi purchased a bottle of the potion.

After the purchase, a small bottle containing a pale green liquid appeared in Lin Yi's hand. Without hesitation, he drank it. 
After drinking it, Lin Yi felt a warm sensation rising from his lower abdomen and then moving downwards.

When the warm sensation reached his penis, Lin Yi quickly unbuttoned his pants and rushed to the mirror to take a look.   To his surprise, he was stunned!

Because he saw his penis instantly reach 30 centimeters.

This made Lin Yi extremely excited.  He immediately exchanged for another bottle and drank it all.  
As a result, his penis swelled a bit, directly increasing from 30 centimeters to 50 centimeters.

As is well known, the size of African men's penises is considered the largest.  Now, Lin Yi is even stronger than them.  He was overjoyed!

He quickly purchased another bottle, wanting to see how much bigger it could get!

After drinking another bottle, but after a minute passed, Lin Yi stared at his penis and realized that it didn't swell at all.  
He couldn't help but angrily exclaim, "Damn, it's fake!  That damn devil is selling fake medicine!"

After cursing for a while, the devil didn't show up. Lin Yi had to sit there and sulk. Suddenly, he had a flash of insight.  
Yes, a man's sexual performance is not only determined by size, but also by endurance. Could it be that the recent growth was in terms of endurance?

But for now, there was no way to test it.  Lin Yi didn't plan on buying any more performance-enhancing potions.  
What if the potion had already reached its limit and drinking more would be a waste?

Lin Yi looked at his remaining Devil Coins and realized that he only had fifty left due to his momentary excitement. He felt a pang of disappointment.  
"This is too extravagant!  Three bottles of performance-enhancing potions cost sixty coins!"

But no matter how much he complained, it was useless.  With only fifty coins left, Lin Yi didn't dare to spend them recklessly in a moment of excitement.  
He carefully searched through the list and realized that his money couldn't buy anything valuable.  He could only afford to buy a few potions.

Potions were the cheapest among all the items, costing only twenty Devil Coins. 
This meant that he could only buy two more bottles of potions, and the remaining ten coins were practically useless!  What a rip-off!

Finally, after much consideration, Lin Yi purchased a bottle of strength-enhancing potion and a bottle of appearance-enhancing potion.  
After all, who doesn't want to look handsome and have six-pack abs?

Lin Yi was an ordinary person, so naturally, he couldn't resist the temptation. He first drank the appearance-enhancing potion and immediately felt a cool sensation on his face.  
So, Lin Yi quickly went to the mirror and was instantly stunned!

The person in the mirror was indeed himself, but he looked much more handsome than before. If Lin Yi used to be considered good-looking, now he could be described as quite handsome!

Carefully examining his reflection, Lin Yi realized that his facial features hadn't undergone any major changes. They had just been subtly adjusted. 
His lips were slightly thinner, his nose was more defined, his eyes were slightly larger, and his skin was a bit fairer.   
All the changes were subtle, making him still recognizable as himself, but undeniably more attractive!

Seeing the remarkable effects of the appearance-enhancing potion, Lin Yi couldn't help but wish for another bottle. Unfortunately, his wallet was empty.

Helplessly, he decided to consume the strength-enhancing potion in one gulp.

This time, Lin Yi made a mistake. He thought the strength-enhancing potion would be similar to the previous one, but it turned out to be completely different.   
He experienced excruciating pain, a pain that was unbearable, and his muscles all over his body began to spasm. The pain was so intense that Lin Yi passed out.

After a while, Lin Yi finally regained consciousness.

"You're finally awake. Human beings have such fragile endurance," a voice said.

As soon as Lin Yi heard the word "human," he knew it was the devil. He couldn't help but retort, "Stop emphasizing that you're not human every time. Always self-deprecating."

"Hehehe, human, you are truly interesting. You are the only one among all my contractees who dares to speak to me like this," the devil chuckled.

"Alright, enough. Don't praise me too much, or I'll feel embarrassed. Tell me, how much strength did the strength-enhancing potion give me, considering the pain it caused?" Lin Yi asked.

"According to your human standards, your physical strength now should be equivalent to that of a professionally trained soldier," the devil replied.

"Ah, only equivalent to a soldier?" Lin Yi's face instantly fell with disappointment.

"Human, don't be ungrateful. You've caught up to others who have trained hard for years just by sleeping. Aren't you satisfied?" the devil retorted.

"Hehe!"   Lin Yi chuckled. "If humans were always satisfied, what would be the point of having demons like you?"

Upon hearing Lin Yi's words, the devil paused for a moment, then burst into laughter. "Hahaha, human, I was right about you. You truly are amusing."

Rolling his eyes, Lin Yi muttered to himself, calling the devil crazy, and then got up to examine his physique in the mirror.

However, as soon as Lin Yi approached the mirror, he felt that something was off. He used to only reach the middle of the mirror, but now he was at eye level with it!

Did he grow taller?!
