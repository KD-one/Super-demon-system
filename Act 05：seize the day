After reading the demon shop, Lin Yi's face changed. He suddenly realized something and quickly raised his arm to check the time on his watch. It was already 2:30, 
and his expression turned even more serious. "No, I'm running out of time!"

He hurriedly ran to the road and shouted, "Taxi!"

Lin Yi hailed a taxi and got in.

At that moment, the voice of the demon sounded, "Human, why are you in such a hurry?"

Ignoring the demon, Lin Yi urgently asked the taxi driver, "Sir, how long does it take to get to the stock exchange center?"

"Oh, about half an hour," the driver casually replied.

Half an hour! Lin Yi's heart sank. Damn it, he was so focused on the demon shop that he forgot about the time!

The stock exchange center in Jianghai City closed at 3 o'clock every day, and it was already 2:30. If he didn't hurry, he would miss it. He couldn't believe he wouldn't make it!

With this in mind, Lin Yi took out a stack of money from his pocket and handed it to the taxi driver. The driver was stunned as he looked at the stack of red banknotes.

At that moment, Lin Yi said, "Hurry, get me to the stock exchange center within twenty minutes. Don't worry about red lights or green lights. 
As long as we arrive on time, this money is yours."

The taxi driver, as if injected with chicken blood, immediately changed his casual attitude and became excited. After all, the money was worth more than his daily earnings.

He said eagerly, "Alright, please hold on tight."

With that, the car sped off like an arrow.

Why was Lin Yi in such a hurry to go to the stock exchange center? Only he knew the answer.

Having been reborn twelve years ago, he naturally had the ability to know the future. Today was actually the lowest point for the stock of the Oil Overlord Corporation. 
Oil Overlord Corporation might not be well-known now, but in twelve years, it would become the most valuable company in China!

Its CEO, Lin Jianwen, would become the undisputed richest person in China!

The so-called Oil Overlord was a product that, when dropped into gasoline or diesel, could increase the fuel efficiency by fifty percent!

What does that mean? It means that if you fill up your car with gasoline for two hundred, and then add a drop of Oil Overlord, your fuel can be used as if it were worth three hundred.

With such an effect, who with a car wouldn't buy a bottle of Oil Overlord?

Furthermore, the government later promoted Oil Overlord to save energy and reduce emissions. This led to the skyrocketing success of Oil Overlord Corporation in the stock market. 
In just a few years, Lin Jianwen became the richest person in China.

Lin Yi had seen news interviews of Lin Jianwen on CCTV and was well aware of these events. 
Therefore, today was the perfect opportunity for him to buy all the stocks of Oil Overlord Corporation while it was at its lowest point.

By becoming the chairman of Oil Overlord Corporation, Lin Yi envisioned himself as the future richest person in China. 
He would then marry a beautiful and wealthy woman, reaching the pinnacle of his life.

Simultaneously, this was why Lin Yi was willing to trade twenty years of his life for two billion demon coins. 
It wasn't that he was foolish or valued money over life, but rather he wanted to use the money to acquire Oil Overlord Corporation.

Two billion demon coins were like Water without a source, once used, they would be gone. But Oil Overlord Corporation was like a golden goose that would lay golden eggs. 
By acquiring it, he would become the richest person in China.

Trading twenty years of his life for the title of the richest person in China, Lin Yi believed it was worth it.

He believed that in one's lifetime, living until sixty was enough. If one was alive, they should pursue an extraordinary life and live the way they desired. 
Even beggars could live to be a hundred, but who would willingly choose to be a beggar?

Many people might disagree with such thinking, but it was Lin Yi's belief. In his previous life, he had lived aimlessly for decades. In this life, he would seize every opportunity.

As a great revolutionary leader once said, "Ten thousand years is too long, seize the day!"

This was also Lin Yi's belief.

To live, one must live a remarkable life.

Even if it meant flying into the flames like a moth, even if it meant death, he would pursue that fleeting brilliance.

What is the purpose of life? Isn't it to live the life one desires?

No matter the cost, even if it meant sacrificing his life, where his dreams lie, he would go!
